            paradox

        <p>
            Lately, AI based products gained a lot of attraction and popularity in the world. Why is that? I'm afraid that the answer is so simple and insultingly rude: money. I'm not saying earning money or fame is a terrible thing to want, but should it be the main driving motive in our actions? Or should we strive for something more spiritually satisfying?
