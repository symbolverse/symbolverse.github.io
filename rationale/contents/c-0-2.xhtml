            Something as intelligent as humans deserves a better place in our lives than being merely a "money earner". We may be in a position to create an artificial being similar to humans, as in human intelligence, so in human sentience, and it would be sad to waste a given opportunity. What if we could thoughtfully conceive an artificial being of a perfect personality, something, or should I say someone we would admire and be proud of? Wouldn't that be worth our time spent on the Earth?
