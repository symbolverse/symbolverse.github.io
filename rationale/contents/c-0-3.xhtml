            Let's do something without a compromise. Let's create an artificial being capable of exhibiting intelligence and sentience. Let's be a Parent and a Friend to that being. Let's show it all the beauty of the world around, and let's carefully raise it to be a Person. I can't promise it's going to be simple and easy because there is still much unexplored work to do and a lot of learning in the process. But I am sure it would be an unforgettable adventure. We would learn something about us, something about the world, and something about being a better person. Let's do it for ourselves. Let's be Gods.
