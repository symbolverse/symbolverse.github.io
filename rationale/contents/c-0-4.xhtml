            The goal of this project is to provide users with specific tools for creating artificial beings capable of exhibiting intelligence and sentience. We are deliberately limiting the range of this project to bare bones interface to our logical reasoner. Users are left to come up on their own with an AI behavior algorithm utilizing the reasoner. We are aware that this takes a fair amount of users' creativity and sense of ethics, but we want to provide enough freedom for users to express themselves in AI creation. We are looking forward to seeing those awesome beings inspired by Symbolverse. What will the beings say? What will the beings do? What will the beings be? We entrust the users to decide on the answers themselves.
